# Simon Says Game

This is a simple Simon Says game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges the user to remember and repeat a sequence of button flashes. The sequence gets longer with each level, testing the user's memory.

## How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Observe the sequence of button flashes.
3. Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. If you match the sequence correctly, you advance to the next level.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing any key.

## Step-by-Step Process to Build the Game

### 1. **Setup the Project Structure**
   - Create a folder for the project.
   - Inside the folder, create the following files:
     - `index.html`
     - `style.css`
     - `app.js`

### 2. **Write the HTML Structure**
   - Add a basic HTML structure in `index.html`.
   - Include a title, a heading (`<h1>`), and a subheading (`<h2>`).
   - Create a container (`<div class="btn-container">`) to hold the game buttons.
   - Add four buttons with unique IDs (`red`, `yellow`, `green`, `purple`) and classes for styling.
   - Link the `style.css` file for styling and the `app.js` file for functionality.

### 3. **Style the Game with CSS**
   - In `style.css`, center the content using `text-align: center`.
   - Style the buttons with a fixed size, rounded corners, and unique background colors for each button (`red`, `yellow`, `green`, `purple`).
   - Add hover effects or animations for better user experience.

### 4. **Add JavaScript for Game Logic**
   - In `app.js`, define the following variables:
     - `gameSeq` to store the sequence generated by the game.
     - `userSeq` to store the sequence entered by the user.
     - `btns` to hold the button IDs.
     - `level` to track the current level.
     - `started` to check if the game has started.
   - Add an event listener for `keypress` to start the game.
   - Create a `levelUp` function to generate the next step in the sequence and display it to the user.
   - Add a `btnFlash` function to visually flash the buttons.
   - Add a `checkAns` function to compare the user's input with the game sequence.
   - Add a `reset` function to restart the game after a mistake.

### 5. **Add Event Listeners for Buttons**
   - Add click event listeners to each button.
   - When a button is clicked, flash it and add its ID to `userSeq`.
   - Call the `checkAns` function to validate the user's input.

### 6. **Test the Game**
   - Open `index.html` in a browser.
   - Test the game by playing it and ensuring all features work as expected.
